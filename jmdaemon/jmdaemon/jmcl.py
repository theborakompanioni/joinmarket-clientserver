""" jmcl - joinmarket over clightning.
    This is deliberately a very "dumb" plugin.
    It does almost nothing other than try to
    forward messages, received as onionmessages,
    from other nodes.
    Messages are forwarded over a plain TCP socket
    on localhost, using LineReceiver as the app-layer
    way to distinguish individual messages.
    In addition to forwarding messages, there are defined
    a few "control messages", which relate to connected/
    disconnected status of peers.
