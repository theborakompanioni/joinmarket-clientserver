"""
### MESSAGE FORMAT USED on the LN-ONION CHANNELS

( || means concatenation for strings, here)

`rawtlv` as defined in https://lightning.readthedocs.io/lightning-sendonionmessage.7.html
is hex-encoded and therefore is of form:

hex-encoded-varint-message-type || hex-encoded-length-of-message || hex-encoded-message

This encoding must happen here (though, as explained below, the receiving side is different).

The rest of this description is how the third field, `message`, is created, and read:

Since we cannot assume a 1:1 mapping of `nick` to lightning daemon (and therefore peerid),
we prepend with both the Joinmarket nicks (this is slightly awkward but keeps compatibility
with existing IRC message channels).

In text, the message is therefore:

from-nick || COMMAND_PREFIX || to-nick || COMMAND_PREFIX || cmd || " " || innermessage

(COMMAND_PREFIX defined in this package's protocol.py)

Here `innermessage` may be a list of messages (e.g. the multiple offer case) separated by COMMAND PREFIX.

Note that this syntax will still be as was described here:

https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/JoinMarket-Docs/blob/master/Joinmarket-messaging-protocol.md#joinmarket-messaging-protocol

Note also that there is no chunking requirement applied here, based on the assumption that we have a sufficient 1300 byte limit.
That'll probably be changed later.

### CONTROL MESSAGES

The messages `getpeerlist` and `peerlist` are special messages sent to and
from directory servers.

The syntax of `getpeerlist` is:

from-nick || NICK_PEERLOCATOR_SEPARATOR || peer-location

`from_nick` must be a valid Joinmarket nick belonging to the sending node.
The `peer-location` field can either be a 66 character hex-encoded pubkey or a full peer location
as `pubkey@host:port`.

This message is crucial to the network function, since only from here does the directory node know
the match between the nick (which is cryptographically signed in Joinmarket across channels) and the
LN node pubkey. Notice that more than one nick is NOT allowed per LN node; this is deferred to
future updates.

The syntax of `peerlist` is:

nick || NICK_PEERLOCATOR_SEPARATOR || peer-location || "," ... (repeated)

i.e. a serialization of two-element tuples, each of which is a Joinmarket nick followed by a peer
location, as for the `getpeerlist` message.

#### LOCAL CONTROL MESSAGES

There are two messages passed inside the plugin, to Joinmarketd, in response to events in lightningd,
namely the `connect` and `disconnect` events triggered at the LN level. These are used to update
the *state* of existing peers that we have recorded as connected at some point, to ourselves.

The mechanisms here are loosely synchronizing a database of JM peers, with obviously the directory
node(s) acting as a queryable resource. It's notable that there are no guarantees of accuracy or
synchrony here.

PARSING OF RECEIVED JM_MESSAGES
===

The text will be utf-encoded before being hexlified, and therefore the following actions are needed of the receiver:

Extract rawtlv field which is received as encoded json:

json.loads(msg.decode("utf-8"))["unknown_fields"][0]["value"]

(the ["number"] key is used to check for control messages, see below for details).

Then: unhexlify, converting to binary, then .decode("utf-8") again, converting to a string.

Split the string by COMMAND PREFIX and parse as `from nick, to nick, command, message(s)`.

These arguments can be passed into Joinmarket's normal message channel processing, and should be
identical to that coming from IRC.

However, before doing so, we need to identify "public messages" versus private, which does not
have as natural a meaning here as it does on IRC; we impose it by using a to-nick value of PUBLIC
and by sending the message type `687` to the lightning plugin `jmcl.py` instead of the default
message type `685` for privmsgs to a single counterparty. This will instruct the directory server
to send the message to every peer it knows about.
